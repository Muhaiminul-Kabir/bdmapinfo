Mentioning the deaths of four people in Gopalganj, National Citizen Party (NCP) convener Nahid Islam today said his party neither supports nor expects any form of "extrajudicial killings".
"The criminals must be brought to justice through proper legal proceedings. Had the administration and intelligence agencies taken the right steps at the right time, this situation could have been avoided," he wrote on his verified Facebook account today.
At least four people were killed and dozens injured in daylong clashes between law enforcers and Awami League followers who attacked NCP leaders and activists during the party's nationwide "July March" programme.
"The government and the administration must take responsibility for this. We demand a full investigation into the entire incident and prosecution of the criminals involved," he said, adding that The arrests must be made based on specific and credible information.
"Our programme was a pre-announced peaceful initiative. But the Mujibist [Mujibbadi] criminals carried out an armed attack with the intent to kill -- just like they did during the July uprising. The Awami League always wants to create a civil war-like situation," he added.
Nahid further said despite the massacres carried out by the Awami League during the July uprising, many after August 5 wanted to introduce a "refined Awami League". They must remember that the Awami League is no longer a political party, but a criminal organisation," he alleged.
He claimed members the Awami League and its banned student wing Bangladesh Chhatra League yesterday gathered in Gopalganj to carry out the attack as the law enforcers failed to make sufficient arrests after August 5 and those detained were securing bail from courts.
Nahid said their supporters from various upazilas in Gopalganj were prevented from entering the town and buses were stopped, yet they peacefully concluded their meeting.
"While we were on our way out, Awami criminals launched an armed attack. We left the area in accordance with instructions from the security forces," he wrote.
He further alleged that the fascist collaborators and corrupt officials, who can be bought off with money, are embedded at various levels of the administration.
"We had committed to going to Gopalganj. We went -- and now, with the oath taken in the blood of our martyrs, we declare: Mujibism will not be allowed to take root in Gopalganj or anywhere in Bangladesh," he said, adding, "We will go to Gopalganj again."
"If we remain alive, we will hold programmes in every upazila, every village of Gopalganj. The flag of the July mass uprising will fly in every household of Gopalganj. Gopalganj will not belong to the Mujibists—it will belong to the supporters of Bangladesh," Nahid said.
He reiterated that their commitment to the entire country applies equally to Gopalganj and said they oppose any political discrimination against its residents.
"The Awami League has, for generations, endangered the lives of Gopalganj residents, tainted the spirit of the Liberation War, and acted unjustly towards followers of the Sanatan (Hindu) religion. We have declared that we will change this situation," he said.
He expressed gratitude to those who protested and took to the streets after yesterday's attack.
