A court in Kishoreganj yesterday sentenced 13 individuals, including nine members of a family, to life imprisonment in a case filed over the murder of a grocer in 2016 in the district's Karimganj upazila.
District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Nurul Amin Biplob announced the verdict.
The court also fined the convicts Tk 10,000 each. If they fail to pay the fine, they will have to serve six months more in jail, Public Prosecutor Md Jalal Uddin said. All the convicts are residents of Deopur (Kajlahati) village in Karimganj upazila.
According to the case, the accused had a dispute with grocer Syed Ali over a piece of land. On March 23, 2016, when Syed Ali went to the Niamatpur Bus Stand market, he was stabbed in an attack carried out by the accused.
